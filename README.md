### Summary
This is my basic frontend dashboard. It is designed to show some relevent information that may be useful when trying to determine what is best framework to use.

### Build Notes 
This app was built using Node and Express as the webserver with React and Material UI for the front end.

### Key Features
* Three key traits that can be used to help you identify the framework that is right for you. 
* They ability to sort the list of frameworks by any of the key traits.
    + If you value one trait more than the other this maybe useful.
* The ability to remove certain traits from the view.
    + If you don't value one of the traits at all you can easily hide it from view.
